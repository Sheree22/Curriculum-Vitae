            <p class="personelinfo">I am a student at the Nort-West University, currently busy with my third year and pursuing my Bachelor
                of Science degree in Information Technology. I enjoy both the programming and data analysis modules in my
                field of study. As a 21-year old from Uitenhage, I want to complete my degree and be successful in the IT-field. My 
                hobbies include jogging and going to the beach. I am excited about my future and know that I will be 
                a hard-working employee because of the love I have for what I do; it is not only a job, it is a passion.</p>
