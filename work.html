         <h2> Work experience </h2>
         <div class="work">
             <p>During my second year I had the opportunity of working as an intern at Matogen.
                 Matogen is a Software Developing Company where I gained a lot of new skills.
                 This opportunity gave me the chance to experience the working environment and 
                 to work in a team with my colleagues.
             </p>
             <p>At the university I did casual work, which included reading or writing exams for 
                students with disabilities.  
             </p>
             <p> In my spare time I work as a waitress and receptionist, while completing my degree. 
             </p>
