        <h2>2. In this practical I created a 9-Way Puzzle game. The objective was to place the tiles in the correct order by using the empty space to make sliding movements. 
            The system has a graphical interface and reads the board state from a .csv file. My assignment uses a breadth first search and a best first search. It is written in C#
            and in the end I came to the conclusion that the best first search was the more suitable algorithm.
